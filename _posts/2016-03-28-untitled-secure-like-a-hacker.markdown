A couple weeks ago I attended the annual RSA Conference, along with thousands of the top security practitioners in the world. The first day’s theme focused on the need to shift toward a DevOps approach where security solutions are integrated into the Continuous Delivery pipeline via automation and orchestration instead of being manually operated post-deploy. We expected the following days to hear from vendors and others who had been leveraging the best aspects of DevOps in their tools but an interesting thing happened; no one spoke up. Somehow the most necessary fundamental shift in how we approach security in 2016 has fallen on deaf ears at the companies whose jobs are to protect our data.

A bit of background may be helpful: as defined by Wikipedia, [DevOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) (a clipped compound of "development" and "operations") is a culture, movement or practice that emphasizes the collaboration and communication of both software developers and other information-technology (IT) professionals while automating the process of software delivery and infrastructure changes. It aims at establishing a culture and environment where building, testing, and releasing software, can happen rapidly, frequently, and more reliably. The DevSecOps movement builds on the idea that everyone is responsible for security and inherently accepts that retrofitting current solutions is no longer sufficient as hackers have changed the rules and now enjoy the advantage. 

This DevSecOps movement is possible due to the massive shift toward the cloud and the rise of both virtualization and containerization. The combination of new technologies with a cultural shift toward embracing these advances we believe will make DevSecOps the common thread in every security approach in the near future. 

Companies like Netflix and Google are perfect examples of this movement in practice. Netflix went from competing with the brick and mortar Blockbusters of the world to offering entertainment titles immediately over the internet without physical locations. Google’s entire culture is built around a cloud-based ethos and their success has bubbled out into companies in and out of the tech space. 

The biggest reason to shift to a DevSecOps approach is to slow the efforts of hackers. In the ongoing security struggle hackers have two key advantages: they take a continuous approach in their efforts and only have to get in once, and they can be as aggressive as they wish. Both of these realities require fighting fire with fire. Thinking like a hacker is the best way to stop their onslaught. 

This means implementing automated procedures to scan all of your organization’s source code, packages, and libraries. Manual processes using point solutions simply cannot scale due to the shortage of cybersecurity engineers and the sharp reduction in software delivery velocity that results. We are also now in an “API Economy” and new security solutions need to provide a rich set of APIs to enable automation and orchestration.

At Cybric we believe the entire security approach should be flipped on its head and move from defensive tactics to a strategic offensive posture that is both automated and continuous.
