**BOSTON, Massachusetts – November 9, 2015** – [Cybric](https://cybric.io), the provider of continuous security delivery fabric for today’s modern enterprise infrastructure, today announced it has closed $1.3 million in seed funding led by Petrillo Capital and accompanied by angel and strategic investors. Cybric is pioneering the next-generation of cyber-automation and threat remediation and will use this seed funding round to accelerate research and product development.

Organizations rely on Cybric’s continuous security virtualization to dramatically reduce vulnerability identification and remediation time from months to minutes, whether on-premises or in the cloud.

> “Cybersecurity solutions today require significant human capital, which often results in productivity gaps, while the scanning and remediation processes occur serially  -- requiring the previous one to complete before starting the next step,” said Cybric CEO and founder Ernesto DiGiambattista. “By automating and virtualizing the entire process offline in a shadow environment, our solution can run all scanning and remediation in parallel, offloading resources from production and allowing real-time threat identification, isolation and remediation.”

**Cybric’s founders include:**

* Chief Executive Officer - [Ernesto DiGiambattista](https://vimeo.com/cybric/ernesto-digiambattista) (former CTSO of Sentinel Benefits & Security), 

* Chief Innovation Officer - [Mike Kail](https://vimeo.com/cybric/mikedkail) (former CIO & Infrastructure SVP at Yahoo), 

* Chief Operations Officer - [Andrew Gilman](https://vimeo.com/cybric/andrew-gilman) (former GTM exec at Dell EqualLogic and Actifio) 

* Chief Design Officer - [Sean Walter](https://vimeo.com/cybric/seanbwalter) (founder and Chief UI Architect at Actifio).

> “Decades leading security for Fortune 500 companies and significant time working on artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things have confirmed that existing perimeter-based cyber    security methods are no longer sufficient, while regulators are demanding more standardized reporting,” said Steve MacLellan, former Fidelity SVP of Cyber Security and current Cybric  advisor. “To beat criminals at their own game, companies must find – and quickly fix – weaknesses. Cybric is approaching this challenge the right way, recognizing that true security will only come from systems finding and fixing vulnerabilities in real-time with little human 
involvement.”

On average, it took 256 days to spot a breach caused by a malicious attacker, and 82 days to contain it, according to the Ponemon Institute’s [2015 Global Cost of Data Breach Study](http://www.ponemon.org/blog/cost-of-data-breach-grows-as-does-frequency-of-attacks). In an industry with [22% of all cyber security jobs going unfilled](http://www.esg-global.com/blogs/cybersecurity-skills-shortage-panic-in-2015/), and [51% of IT and information security professionals](http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/tufin-and-esg-research-find-hybrid-cloud-adoption-among-the-key-reasons-network-security-operations-is-more-difficult-today-300069161.html) indicating the increase in applications deployed on the network has made network security more difficult, according to ESG, an automated cyber threat remediation tool in a single pane of glass that works in real-time, without human resources, will play a vital role.

> “The cybersecurity market is flooded with over 1200 disparate point tools with customers often 
running nearly 100 products all requiring a high level of operational knowledge and human intelligence.  This reality makes it incredibly challenging to fully understand an organization's holistic security posture, especially in today's borderless enterprise." said Doug Cahill, senior analyst, Enterprise Strategy Group. “ESG’s market research continues to highlight a clear customer requirement for aggregating functionality into a single platform for prevention against attacks and greater operational efficiency. As such, Cybric’s virtualized approach to security promises to allow organizations to fully integrate and automate their security services across a policy-driven fabric to help them quickly identify and fix vulnerabilities across the entire application and infrastructure stack."
