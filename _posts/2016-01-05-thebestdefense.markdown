In 2014, 90% of large organizations reported suffering from some form of breach, and if you followed the news in 2015, things are not getting better. A week doesn’t go by when there isn’t at least one headline about a substantial breach and loss of sensitive data and/or money.

The current plethora of security tools and solutions that take a defensive approach with time-consuming manual detection and remediation obviously aren’t helping companies improve their security posture. This obviously needs to change, and the change will inevitably come from a disruptive startup as many of the current incumbents suffer from Innovator’s Dilemma.

What I envision is an overall framework or platform that seamlessly integrates current and future best-of-breed solutions and performs penetration and application security testing against a copy of the production infrastructure before the code updates are deployed. This is analogous to what platforms like Jenkins and CircleCI have done to the continuous integration and deployment workflows. 

Security best practices are now maintained in real-time, instead of running potentially chaotic tests during prime business hours against your production infrastructure, CISOs and their teams are now part of the “DevOps toolchain”, instead of being either a prohibitive gate or discovering vulnerabilities that have been deployed days/weeks/months after the fact.

This is what we at Cybric are developing and have coined a “Continuous Security Delivery Fabric”, with the goal of automating the detection of security vulnerabilities and the orchestration of remediation without manual, human interaction. The corresponding data around those actions is stored to assist the platform in becoming smarter over time. CISOs and their teams are now freed up to spend time on innovation and development, instead of always being in reactionary, “fire-fighting” mode.
