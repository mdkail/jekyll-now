As i wrote in my last blog post, there needs to be a cultural shift in the collaboration and interaction between the DevOps and Security teams. In most organizations today, the Security teams are “de-coupled” from the overall Application Development and Delivery Lifecycle, which often results in contention between the teams, and a disparate approach to overall security.

Cybersecurity methodologies and tools also haven’t kept pace with the transformation to CI/CD, programmatic infrastructure, and the “API Economy”. Important functions such as code security review, penetration testing, and application vulnerability scanning still require manual intervention by Cybersecurity engineers, and often have to be performed during “off-hours” to avoid disruption of one’s Production application environment.

Another challenge facing Cybersecurity teams is the shear number of point-solutions and tools, and the disparate nature of them. The following infographic from Momentum Partners displays this landscape quite nicely.

Now that I’ve outlined the current state and the existing issues and challenges, I’d like to discuss our views at Cybric on how to inject the ‘Sec’ functionality into the ‘DevOps’ collaboration and automation culture to truly create the culture of ‘DevSecOps’, which is one where Cybersecurity becomes part of everyone’s responsibility and overall risk score is a quantifiable metric.

The first step is to develop a “cybersecurity tool hyper-convergence” platform, which is what we at Cybric call our “Continuous Security Delivery Fabric”. Penetration Testing and Application+Code Vulnerability scanning are delivered through an automation and orchestration platform that can be scheduled according to a company’s given software deployment cycle. Cybersecurity engineers are now freed from the shackles of manual testing and potential vulnerabilities are addressed before they are deployed to Production. The cultural “win” is that this overall continuous process will build cybersecurity awareness, which is a positive outcome for everyone.

My next blog post will be around maximizing the ROI of your existing cybersecurity tool investment.
