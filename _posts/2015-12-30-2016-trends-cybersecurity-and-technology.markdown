As 2015 winds to a close and we hear about another extensive data breach, this one potentially affecting [191 million voters](http://www.engadget.com/2015/12/28/voter-record-database-leak/), it is obvious to me that the status quo isn’t working to improve the overall security posture for organizations. We’re falling further and further behind as the data center network perimeter disappears, and [shadow IT is embraced](http://www.information-age.com/technology/security/123460701/how-balance-innovation-risk-when-it-comes-shadow-it) to drive innovation.  The Bad Guys continue to outsmart the most advanced organizations that have implemented every possible solution under the sun.

The pace of technology innovation is accelerating  as megatrends such as “Cloud Computing” and “The Rise of the Developer” gain more adoption by companies undergoing their “Digital Transformation” initiatives. We need to take a pragmatic and transformational approach  in improving our security postures versus continuing with introducing new “flavor of the month” tools that has become everyday practice in the CyberSecurity sector.

“Scale Out” works well for sectors such as Compute and Storage, but have an inverse effect as the industry doesn’t need more disparate security solutions and point tools. CISOs and their Security teams need the ability to start playing offense. Offensive security is based two critical strategies; Automation and Orchestration. 2016 is the year to make SecDevOps a vibrant and cohesive culture, which will bring the CISO back into the Continuous Delivery platform. According to Trustwave’s 2015 report, 93% of breaches were due to human error, so let’s mitigate this with a solution that gives companies the ability to define “Infrastructure Security as Policy” and validate that policy before each code update deployment.

**Other trends in 2016 will simply be a continuation of prior years’ successes, and include:**

**Cloud Computing** ([AWS continues to kick ass and take names](http://venturebeat.com/2015/10/22/amazon-web-services-generates-2-08b-in-revenue-in-q3-2015-up-78-over-last-year/)) 
AWS is in a league of its own: 

Gartner estimates the cloud server capacity of AWS at [10 times the next 14 competitors](http://investorplace.com/2015/11/orcl-dethrone-amazon-aws-amzn/) combined, with five times the storage capacity of those same 14 companies.

**Mobile** -- This is outlined by someone far more intelligent than me: 
[Benedict Evans - 16 mobile theses](http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2015/12/15/16-mobile-theses )

**Big|Fast|Streaming Data** -- Data will continue to be the “currency of business”, as well as the “currency of the future”, so those companies who can help the Enterprise remove the signal from the noise will flourish.

**Docker** -- I’d be remiss if I neglected to acknowledge the buzz around (Docker) containers, but I believe the real trend will be the move to web-scale solutions around container orchestration such as [Kubernetes.](http://http://kubernetes.io/)

**{Sec}DevOps** -- As I outlined above, the cultural shift to DevOps will now include the CISO, who will be given the proverbial “seat at the table” as CyberSecurity becomes a Board/CEO level conversation.

**OpenStack** --  It’s been described as a “science experiment” by many IT leaders that I’ve spoken to, which doesn’t bode well for a long term future. There is also a shortage in Engineering talent that can configure and maintain an OpenStack environment, and while service companies such as Mirantis have done well, that’s a challenging business model to scale.

**Storage** -- In the “non-sexy but needed” category, we will see the secular shift from spinning disk to flash storage, as well as innovations in copy data management as startups such as Cohesity and Rubrik gain momentum.

**Incumbents** -- In 2016 we will shift from discussing Unicorns to Dinosaurs, and at least 1 large incumbent will lose its way. “Big Iron/Big Footprint” solutions shift to “Scale-Out/On-Demand” solutions and CapEx budgets become reallocated to forecastable OpEx payments.

**Internet of Things** -- The buzz will be killed by a significant security event, which will mean a huge opportunity for forward-thinking CyberSecurity companies to develop a scalable solution.

In closing, irrespective of whether you agree or disagree with my views, 2016 will continue to be an amazingly progressive year and I’m just happy to be part of the transformation.
