Today, the non-profit, [Homeland Security Foundation of America  (HSFA)](http://www.hsfamerica.org/2015/12/hsfa-white-paper-continuous-security-delivery-platforms-identified-as-best-method-for-expedient-vulnerability-identification-and-threat-remediation/) issued a white paper calling for a “continuous and proactive approach to securing critical infrastructure in America.” The group’s white paper found “In HSFA’s evaluation of emerging security virtualization solutions, our research led us to determine that Cybric Inc. provides an integrated, automated cybersecurity platform for expedient vulnerability identification and threat remediation.”

HSFA’s mission is to advance hometown security, while protecting civil liberties by working with local, state and Federal agencies, organizations and communities.  

The paper went on to note:

**HSFA recommends new standards focus on solutions that provide a continuous security delivery for today’s modern enterprise infrastructure. Government and organizations should rely on security virtualization to dramatically reduce vulnerability identification and remediation time from months to near real-time, whether on-premises or in the cloud. HSFA implores that security virtualization focus on best-of-breed solutions that identify the risk, remediate the exploit, retain the IT security professional brain trust via a single management view, and regulate integrated security scanning and remediation directly into the development process.**

The Cybric team is thrilled the HSFA and others responsible for protecting the homeland are demanding a more holistic approach to cybersecurity — particularly when it comes to the very health and safety of everyday Americans.
