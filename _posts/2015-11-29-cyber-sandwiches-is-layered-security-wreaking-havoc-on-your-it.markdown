Let’s face it,  we’re against the ropes when it comes to cybersecurity. Despite deploying layers upon layers of security tools, they’re not integrated, orchestrated or automated.  And as we expand services far beyond the walls of our datacenter, accelerate application development with DevOps, and integrate microservices together for richer user experiences - the perimeter is gone. Infrastructure security is different now, and we need a different approach to cybersecurity that’s aligned with the new DevSecOps reality.

Fortunately, security vendors have been innovating at a rapid pace, and we now have THOUSANDS of new tools to scan and address a myriad of Cybersecurity vulnerabilities.   But despite our best efforts in 2015, we’ve seen the worst year on record for fines related to cybersecurity attacks and breaches:

- Approximately $364 billion was spent in 2014 to combat and recover from data breaches.
- Businesses spent roughly $491 billion because of malware-related incidents.
- It costs a company about $3.8 million to respond to one data breach. This is a 23% increase from 2013.
- The United States and Germany have the highest cost per recovered breached record at $217 and $211, respectively.
- Costs associated with lost business increased from $1.23 million in 2013 to $1.57 million in 2015.

It’s not that we haven’t purchased enough technologies to keep our organizations safe against Cyber attacks.  Gartner says global spending on IT security is set to increase 8.2 percent in 2015 to $77 billion, and the world will spend $101 billion on information security in 2018.  Given the continuous, evolutionary nature of cyber-attacks, coupled with the low share of total IT spend which security accounts for, the overall spend level is likely to rise dramatically over the next 18 months. The additional spend will come from more security software and the extra IT staffing required to address the new waves of alerts and vulnerabilities these create - it’s just havoc!

**So we’ve spent the budget, we’ve layered security, we’ve got best of breed, and it’s still not working.  To continue down this path is Einstein’s Definition of Insanity: *Doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.***

What if we could make our current security scanning tools run faster, without impacting production environments or current IT staffing levels?  That’s exactly what Cybric’s integrated approach to finding and fixing cyber vulnerabilities gives you.  

**We can help you by:**

**A.** Integrate existing security scanning tools into policies  

**B.** Automatically running security scans against a virtual copy of your infrastructure on-demand

**C.** Virtualizing security operations and integrate remediation into existing ITIL and release procedures
