Automation is not a new concept, and the core definition is “the application of systems and information technologies to reduce the need for manual, human work”. With the adoption of the DevOps “culture” by many IT organizations, Automation is a key component (CAMS), yet the same methodologies haven’t been applied to Security.
 

 
Manual approaches to Security aren’t working, as shown by the sheer number and magnitude of the breaches that have occurred in 2015. There is also a severe shortage of CyberSecurity professionals, which Cisco estimated to be a shortfall of ~1 million in 2014 and that’s expected to increase to at least 1.5 million by 2019. We simply can’t keep applying Engineers and manual operations to the Security process.
 
Automation and Orchestration are going to be the key components of a disruptive solution that will continue to scale and free up Engineers to do actual Engineering work instead of spending time attempting to detect threats, determine the root cause, detonate the thread, and then perform the remediation and reporting post-mortem.  Today, on average, it takes 379 days to detect and remediate an exploit. Think about that, over 1 year for every single exploit. If we combine that statistic with the talent shortfall epidemic, the Bad Guys will continue to prevail.
 

 
Google, Tesla and others are disrupting the automotive industry by applying behavioral analytics and overall sensor data to create the first self-driving cars that continue to learn over time. We are developing a similar platform for Cyber Security that will continuously monitor all of your infrastructure and applications, ingest the important “signals” while ignoring the “noise”, and apply deep learning methods to allow the platform to become more intelligent and resilient over time.
 

**The Orchestration virtuous cycle will consist of:**
 
·         Identify - continuous scanning of applications and data

·         Protect - apply ethical hacking methods

·         Detect - anomalous behaviors

·         Respond  - comprehensive reporting

·         Recover - self-healing
 
Much like the self-driving car, this comprehensive solution will be a game-changer for the Cyber Security industry, and allow for Security professionals to start playing offense instead of defense.
