Welcome to the biggest day ever for eCommerce. For the first time we will purchase more online today than in brick-and-mortar stores. Nearly $3 Billion dollars worth of transactions are happening online, right now - thats over $2,000,000 per minute!

Equally as impressive are the billion's in technology investments retailers have made this year to digitize their business - making Cyber Monday possible. Entire supply chains, ordering systems, sales and marketing programs, finance and forecasting tools, accounting software, manufacturing systems can now be described as code - just 1's and 0's.

Cyber Monday is also one of the biggest days for CyberSecurity.  After all, it's your credit card and other personally identifiable (PI) information that makes up today's $3B transactions.  Retailer's IT security investments are on center stage today to protect your data against viruses, malware, and hackers. Consumers simply don't trust brands and retailers who've been compromised.  Approximately $364 billion was spent by organizations in 2014 to combat and recover from data breaches. 

When it comes to hacking and data breaches, it's not a question of "if" its a question of "how bad, and how long has it been going on." Using today's very best security scanning and vulnerability detection systems it takes days, weeks, or even years before a breach is detected and remediated.  In today's 24x7 eCommerce world this is not acceptable, there has to be a better way.  

At Cybric, we're tackling this problem head-on. By shrinking the times to find and fix a vulnerability down from months to minutes.  We're also a proud sponsor of "Cybric Monday" with the goal of making your Cyber Monday experience safer, secure and more enjoyable.  Check out our overview video below and happy shopping!
