With warm spring weather on its way, most of America knows it’s almost time for March Madness. For tech companies in Boston, that also means it’s time for BostInno’s friendly, yet competitive,  [Tech Madness Competition](http://bostinno.streetwise.co/all-series/bostinno-tech-madness-2016-bracket-revealed-voting-opens/). 

On that note, we are thrilled to announce that we are one of the top 64 finalists in the Tech Madness Competition. The 2016 Tech Madness Bracket includes 64 Boston tech companies who are making innovative strides. The winners will be determined by community voting with readers answering one question as they decide who to support: **Which Boston tech companies do you think will be the most valuable in five years?**

With Boston’s active and innovative tech community, it’s not an easy task to stand out among the crowd. Our team of engineers, investors, customers and partners believe our revolutionary continuous security delivery fabric will drive Cybric to be one of Boston’s most innovative and valuable tech companies. In five years, Cybric will be the leader of security automation and orchestration, once and for all replacing the many disparate security tools with a single seamless security fabric.
