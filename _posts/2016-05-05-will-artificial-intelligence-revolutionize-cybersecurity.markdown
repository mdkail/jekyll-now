*With criminal hackers becoming more effective at breaking into computer systems, cybersecurity researchers, government agencies, and academics are looking to artificial intelligence to detect – and fight – cyberattacks.*  

Most people probably have no idea they encounter artificial intelligence technology at nearly every turn on the Internet. It's how retailers track shoppers' behavior and show them ads that attempt to match their tastes in clothing or electronics. 

While that's a relatively simply use of artificial intelligence, often known as just AI, researchers, entrepreneurs, and US government officials are investing heavily into moving much more advanced AI into health care for such pursuits as drug research, automotive technology like self-driving cars, and even for teaching computers how to track and defend themselves against hackers. 

In fact, within the past year, security startups, leading academics, government agencies, and some of the largest digital security firms in the country have invested heavily in AI technology for cybersecurity, believing that recent advancements in processing power could allow computers to outperform humans when it comes to many aspects of defending networks.

"Just imagine a world in which bots are out there looking for vulnerabilities and other bots or artificial intelligence is simultaneously poking holes, plugging holes, poking back," said Ryan Calo, a law professor and director of the Tech Policy Lab at the University of Washington, a think tank that examines cybersecurity and AI policy.

This week, the White House announced it will host a series of summertime workshops to further explore the benefits of AI in the government and the private sector.

"AI systems can also behave in surprising ways, and we’re increasingly relying on AI to advise decisions and operate physical and virtual machinery – adding to the challenge of predicting and controlling how complex technologies will behave," said Ed Felten, deputy US chief technology officer, in a statement announcing the initiative. 

Additionally, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the Pentagon's research wing, recently announced plans to develop a program to use AI to uncover culprits – whether criminal gangs or nation-state hackers – behind cyberattacks. 

That's the kind of technology that can provide a leg up to security teams attempting to find attacks in reams of network traffic every day, said Steve MacLellan, chief executive officer of Blue Sky Management and Research, a firm that invests in cybersecurity startups.

"Humans are overwhelmed by data,” said Mr. MacLellan. "The promise of AI says, if I can teach the machine to dynamically adapt. If I’m getting these hundreds of different signals coming in, the machine learning part says ‘Hey, this one is more important than that one.'"

Indeed, the amount of data that cybersecurity professionals and researchers contend with can be overwhelming, and the amount of information on cyberattacks and malware is growing expeditiously every day. 

Still, many AI researchers and backers say that AI systems will eventually become smart enough to know the difference between an innocuous computer glitch and a malicious attack.

"As technology grows, you'll have smart houses, you'll have the Internet of things, you'll have all of these things are generating sensor data," said Blue Sky's MacLellan. "You need a platform that can consume that data."
