Despite the fact that DevOps is more of a cultural description than an official job title, there are currently ~11,000 job openings on LinkedIn looking for “DevOps Engineers”. I believe there is good evidence the cultural shift to bridging Development and Operations is well underway and here to stay. As defined by Wikipedia, DevOps (a clipped compound of "development" and "operations") is a culture, movement or practice that emphasizes the collaboration and communication of both software developers and other information-technology (IT) professionals while automating the process of software delivery and infrastructure changes. Personally I am, and continue to be,  a huge proponent of the core tenets of DevOps -- Collaboration, Automation, Measurement, and Sharing (CAMS).

The challenge continues to be, bringing the security team and CISO into collaboration with the CI/CD pipeline. RSA’s 2016 conference was filled with existing and new vendors, most with point-solution tools that don’t integrate into the modern (DevOps) software development lifecycle.

Application vulnerability testing is still mostly an afterthought and when performed, tends to take place on a periodic basis (weekly, monthly, quarterly) with manual processes and significant security engineer involvement. This testing often creates a contentious relationship between the DevOps and Security teams because the manual operations required dramatically slow down the overall development process.

At Cybric we believe CISOs and their Security teams must make a cultural shift toward taking a programmatic view towards application and infrastructure security testing. Automating existing manual processes should always be top of mind, and understanding the overall CI/CD pipeline and how to work inline within it is the ultimate goal to efficient and effective applications that can withstand attacks. This can be boiled down to encouraging everyone- regardless of their title/role- to think of security as their responsibility. 

We recognized early on that there was no common platform to enable Security teams to initiate this cultural and process shift, and lead us to develop our Continuous Security Delivery Fabric. This aggressive, automated and continuous platform will revolutionize the security landscape. 

Join our movement early and secure your organization from threats today and in real-time going forward.
