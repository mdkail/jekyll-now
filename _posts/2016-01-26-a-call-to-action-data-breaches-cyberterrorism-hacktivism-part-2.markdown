*Data Breaches. Cyberterrorism. Hacktivism.*

It's incredible we've been completely desensitized to these words. 

They invoke images ranging form lone-wolf hackers in hoodies to armies of state-sponsored criminals.  The unfortunate reality is the vast majority of vulnerabilities are introduced into production environments inadvertently due to misconfigurations, un-patched systems, or poor Q/A protocols.  

There are innumerable examples of these breaches and internal errors. As reported by Daniel Cooper of Engadget, “Washington's Department of Corrections has been forced to admit that around three percent of the prison population has been released early since 2002.” Luckily, the errors only “knocked 100 days or so off sentences.” So, from a practical standpoint, the 3,200 inmates that were released early only avoided about three more months of subsequent jail time.  

The real problem is that it took the DoC a decade to catch the error after the family of a victim pointed out the issue to them in 2012.

This speaks to the fact that there needs to be greater internal and independent oversight placed over bodies at the time of system integration as it is often internal errors that leave our information vulnerable.

The DoC calculation error did not yield any large scale ramifications in the grand scheme of things, but other breaches and errors can. The first-ever Verizon Protected Health Information Data Breach Report was released this past month—revealing 1,900 personal identity breaches between 1984 and 2004. Also, over 392 million records were exposed—half the population of the United States.  

Medical records, credit card data, and LAN logins all qualify as examples of personal health information (PHI), and Senior Consultant of the Verizon RISK team Suzanne Widup noted that much of the sensitive information is being volunteered by employees on worker’s compensation and wellness program files—Widup urges companies “to treat that data just like any other data.” 

Most incidents pertaining to PHI occur in healthcare. “Misuse, error, and physical action” account for nearly half of all problems in hospitals and ambulatory services. Widup expressed her frustration in the report that healthcare continues to lag behind other fields when it comes to putting in encryption as a control.  

**The weak security of healthcare data is having far-reaching effects.**
