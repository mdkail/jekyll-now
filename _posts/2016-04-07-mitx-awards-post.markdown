We’re honored to have been selected as a finalist in the **Most Innovative Cybersecurity Technology** category for the [20th Annual MITX Awards](http://mitxawards.org/). Held annually by the Massachusetts Innovation & Technology Exchange, the awards recognize excellence in technology developed in New England.   

Congratulations to the other finalists who are all helping organizations become safer and more secure through their software:* 

- Confer - Endpoint security tools
- CyberArk - Privileged Account Security tools
- Digital Guardian - Data Loss Prevention tools

At Cybric, we're focused on dramatically simplifying how security is done through automation and orchestration. Today’s security professionals have more security tools than ever but are less and less secure.  Our users tell us that current security offerings (*including our fellow finalists*) are too focused on manual actions, and remain simple/point tools. Traditional security approaches simply can’t keep up with modern enterprise thats dynamic, cloud-first, and increasingly regulated.

That's why we developed our cybersecurity automation & orchestration solution for modern enterprises. For the first time ever, global enterprise organizations will be able to rely on continuous security delivery services to dramatically reduce the time to conduct vulnerability scanning and remediation, from months to minutes. Our platform enables automation of all security tasks to gain efficiencies.  We're excited to deliver outcomes that revolutionize security for our customers, giving them the power to run security policies 24/7 with zero impact to their production systems. 

Being selected as a finalist by the MITX judging team for tech in New England is a real honor, and we look forward to demoing our product live at the Awards Ceremony on May 25th for the final round of judging.

Since 1996 the MITX Awards have grown to become the largest and most prestigious awards competition in the country showcasing the best creative marketing and technological accomplishments emerging from New England. This year over 120 senior leaders from Boston businesses judged entries for the 33 MITX award categories. 

“For 20 years, MITX has been celebrating the talented and creative minds across New England - innovators that have made this the thriving technology and innovation hub it has become,” said MITX President Amy Quigley. “This year’s finalists are no exception. The ideas keep getting bigger and bolder. We are thrilled to honor their amazing achievements!”
