*Beta Program Will Provide Access to  Patent-Pending Automated Cloud Cybersecurity Services Reducing Vulnerability Identification and Remediation from Months to Minutes*
 
**BOSTON, Massachusetts – February 11, 2016 –**  Cybric, the security virtualization pioneer, today announced the expansion of their early access program. Cybric delivers the next-generation of automation and threat detection to reduce vulnerability identification time from months to minutes.  [Click here to apply.](http://svy.mk/1o7DDcB)

“We’re excited to expand our early access program, which has already yielded positive feedback and innovations from our service provider and large enterprise customers,” said Ernesto DiGiambattista, CEO and founder of Cybric.

Leading global enterprises and service providers have worked closely with Cybric’s development teams, who are excited to share the company’s cloud-based cybersecurity services with a growing community. The expanded beta services will include:

**•Continuous Penetration Testing & Auto-Remediation Service for AWS**

**•Continuous Source Code Testing & Auto-Remediation Service for GITHUB**

*“I loved the Cybric value proposition because it solves so many of my problems as dual CIO/CISO. We simply didn’t have the time, money or people to accomplish all the vulnerability scanning and remediation work required,” said Robert Reeder, former BBJ CIO of the Year and Cegment CIO. “As their security virtualization technology rapidly matures, I’m enthusiastic about the disruptive innovation that Cybric’s services will have on the entire cybersecurity marketplace.”*

*"Cybric will give our clients another powerful choice in cybersecurity which integrates and extends our existing infrastructure investments," said Abdul Altamimi, founder & CTO RestorePoint. "We’ve been working closely through Cybric’s product development cycle, and are impressed by the innovative approach to vulnerability detection and auto-remediation.  As a leading provider of cloud solutions, we’re always looking for new services that help our clients solve real problems – the continuous security delivery fabric does just that.”*

**Continuous Penetration Testing Services** 
Today’s approach to penetration testing is overly complex, expensive and disruptive to business operations.  Organizations struggle to run these tests aggressively in their production environments and therefore do them too infrequently and during off-hours.  Cybric’s beta penetration testing-as-a-service allows users to continuously test and fix their environments 24x7 with zero production impact.


**Continuous Source Code Testing Service**
Developers are constantly challenged to deliver better applications faster. New DevOps methodologies wait until the end of the build process to perform security checks. Cybric’s continuous code testing incorporates security into the natural development cycle – enabling organizations to release hardened applications that are less susceptible to security flaws.

*“The ESG Lab team validated the approach Cybric employs with the Continuous Security Delivery Fabric to automate and optimize the process of enterprise vulnerability scanning, exploit detection and remediation. We deployed the framework in less than a minute, and explored how the intuitive user interface could be used to easily evaluate risk and apply automated security policies to shrink exploit windows.,” said Doug Cahill, ESG Senior Analyst in reference to the ESG Lab team’s validation report.*
